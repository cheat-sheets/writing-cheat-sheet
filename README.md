## Principles of Effective Writing

### Cut Unnecessary Words and Phrases
 
Learn how to part with your words!

The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components: 
- every word that serves no function,
- every long word that could be a short word, 
- every adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb, 
- every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what -

these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence. 
And they usually occur in proportion to education and rank. (William Zinsser)

**Bad**: This paper **provides a review of** the **basic tenets of cancer biology study design**, using 
**as examples studies** that **illustrate the methodologic challenges or that demonstrate successful solutions to 
the difficulties inherent in biological research**.

**Good**: This paper **reviews** **cancer biology study design**, using 
**examples** that **illustrate specific challenges and solutions**.

Common clutter:
1. Dead weight words and phrases
   - As it is well known 
   - As it has been shown
   - It can be regarded that
   - It should be emphasized that
1. Empty words and phrases
   - basic tenets of 
   - important
1. Long words or phrases that could be short
   - A majority of = most
   - A number of = many
   - Are of the same opinion = agree
   - Less frequently occurring = rare
   - All three of the = the three
   - Give rise to = cause
   - Due to the fact that = because
   - Have an effect on = affect
   - Based on the assumption that = if
   - Does not have = lacks
   - Did not remember = forgot
   - Did not pay attention to = ignored
1. Unnecessary jargon and acronyms
1. Repetitive words or phrases
   - challenges/difficulties
   - successful solutions
   - illustrate/demonstrate
1. Adverbs
   - very
   - really
   - quite
   - basically
   - generally
1. Eliminate negatives
   - Bad: She was not often right
   - Good: She was usually wrong
1. Eliminate superfluous uses of "there is / there are"
   - There are many ways in which we can arrange the pulleys
   - We can arrange the pulleys in many ways
1. Omit needless prepositions
   - They agreed that it was true
   - They agreed it was true
 

### Use Active Voice

**Bad**: My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me.

**Good**: I will always remember my first visit to Boston.

Advantages of the active voice:

1. Emphasizes author responsibility 
   - **Bad**: No attempt **was made** to contact non-responders because they **were deemed** unimportant to the analysis.
   - **Good**: **We did not attempt** to contact non-responders because **we deemed** them unimportant to the analysis.
1. Improves readability
   - **Bad**: A strong correlation **was found** between use of the passive voice and other sins of writing.
   - **Good**: **We found** a strong correlation between use of the passive voice and other sins of writing.
1. Reduces ambiguity
   - **Bad**: General dysfunction of the immune system at the leukocyte level **is suggested** by both animal and human studies.
   - **Good**: Both human and animal studies **suggest** that diabetics have general immune dysfunction at the leukocyte level.


### Write with Verbs
 
- **Use strong verbs**
   - **Good**: Loud music **came** from speakers embedded in the walls, and the entire arena **moved** as the hungry 
   crowd **got** to its feet.
   - **Better**: Loud music **exploded** from the speakers embedded in the walls, and the entire arena **shook** as the 
   hungry crowd **leaped** to its feet. 
- **Avoid turning verbs into nouns**
   - **Bad**: During DNA damage, **recognition** of H3K4me3 by ING2 results in **recruitment** of Sin3/HDAC and 
   **repression** of cell proliferation genes.
   - **Good**: During DNA damage, H3K4me3 **recruits** ING2 and Sin3/HDAC, which together **repress** cell 
   proliferation genes.
   
   - Obtain estimates of = estimate 
   - Has seen an expansion in = has expanded
   - Provides a methodologic emphasis = emphasizes methodology 
   - Take an assessment of = assess
   - Offer confirmation of = confirm
   - Make a decision = decide
   - Shows a peak = peaks
- **Don't bury the main verb** (keep the subject and main verb close together at the start of the sentence)
   
## Punctuation

Increasing power to separate:

- Comma
- Colon
- Dash
- Parenthesis
- Semicolon
- Period

Increasing formality:

- Dash
- Parenthesis
- Comma, Colon, Semicolon, Period

**Semicolon** connects to independent clauses.

*Example*: Kennedy could be a cold and vain man, and he led a life of privilege. But he knew something about the world;
he also cared about it.

*Example*: It was the best of times; it was the worst of times.

Semicolons are also used to separate items in lists that contain internal punctuation.

*Example*: It happened because people organized and voted for better prospects; because leaders enacted smart, forward
looking policies; because people's perspectives opened up, and with them, societies did too.

**Parenthesis** can be used to insert an afterthought or explanation (a word, phrase, or sentence) into a passage that 
is grammatically complete without it.
  - If you remove the material within the parentheses, the main point of the sentence should not change.
  - Parentheses give the reader permission to skip over the material.
  
**Colon** can be used after an independent clause to introduce a list, quote, explanation, conclusion, or amplification.
"The colon has more effect than the comma, less power to separate than the semicolon, and more formality than the dash." - Strunk and White.

*Example* (list or explanation): The hydrogen bonds are made as follows: purine position 1 to pyrimidine position 1;
purine position 6 to pyrimidine position 6.

*Example* (explanation or amplification): That's one reason why I'm so optimistic about the future: the constant
churn of scientific progress. 

*Example* (to amplify or extend, joins two independent clauses if the second amplifies or extends the first): 
Companies use Marsh for the same reason that home sellers use real estate agents: The agent's knowledge and 
experience is supposed to help the client get the right deal at the right price.

**Dash** can be used to add emphasis or to insert an abrupt definition or description almost anywhere in the sentence.

*Example*: But my fellow Americans, whatever mix of motives led us to create an Electoral College majority for 
Donald Trump to become president — and overlook his lack of preparation, his record of indecent personal behavior, 
his madcap midnight tweeting, his casual lying about issues like "millions" of people casting illegal votes in this 
election, the purveying of fake news by his national security adviser, his readiness to appoint climate change deniers 
without even getting a single briefing from the world's greatest climate scientists in the government he'll soon lead 
and his cavalier dismissal of the C.I.A.'s conclusions about Russian hacking of our election — have no doubt about 
one thing: We as a country have just done something incredibly reckless.

*Example*: The drugs did more than prevent new fat accumulation. They also triggered overweight mice to shed 
significant amounts of fat - up to half their body weight. (emphasis)


## Tips

**Grammar**:

1. "Data are" not "data is" (The word "data" is plural)
   - These data show an unusual trend.
   - The data support the conclusion.
   - The data are critical.
1. Compare to vs compare with
   - compare to = to point out similarities between different things
   - compare with = to point out differences between similar things.
   - Ex.: Brain tumors are relatively rare compared with more common cancers, such as those of the lung, breast etc.
1. That vs which
   - "That" is restrictive (defining pronoun)
   - "Which" is nonrestrictive (non-defining) pronoun
   
**Parallelism**

Pairs of ideas joined by "and", "or", or "but" should be written in parallel form.

*Example*: The velocity decreased by 50% but the pressure decreased by only 10%.

*Another Example*:

*Unparallel*: If you want to be a good doctor, you must study hard, critically think about the medical literature,
and you should be a good listener.

*Parallel*: If you want to be a good doctor you must study hard, listen well, and think critically about the medical 
literature.

**The rule of three's** (in lists, examples).

*Example*: It happened because people organized and voted for better prospects; because leaders enacted smart,
forward looking policies; because people's perspectives opened up, and with them, societies did too.
