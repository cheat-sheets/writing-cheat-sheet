## Principles of Effective Writing

### Cut unnecessary words and phrases
 
Learn how to part with your words!

The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components: 
- every word that serves no function,
- every long word that could be a short word, 
- every adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb, 
- every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what -

these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence. 
And they usually occur in proportion to education and rank. (William Zinsser)

   crowd **got** to its feet.

## Grammar Tips

1. "Data are" not "data is" (The word "data" is plural)
   - These data show an unusual trend.
   - The data support the conclusion.
   - The data are critical.
1. Compare to vs compare with
   - compare to = to point out similarities between different things
   - compare with = to point out differences between similar things.
   - Ex.: Brain tumors are relatively rare compared with more common cancers, such as those of the lung, breast etc.
1. That vs which
   - "That" is restrictive (defining pronoun)
   - "Which" is nonrestrictive (non-defining) pronoun
